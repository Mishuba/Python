#Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

#Python is used for Web development (Server-side), software Development, Mathematic, System Scripting.

print("Python can be used on a server to create web applications, alongside software to create workflows, to connect database systems. It can also read and modify files, to handle big data and perform complex mathematics, used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.")

#Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This mean that protytping can be very quick.

#Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

print("Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.")

print("Python relies on indentation, using whtiespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. ")

Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned 
to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes)
