#You can access python from the command line by typing python or py
        #python

#When you are doing using python through the command line use exit()
    # exit()


# also notes when writing python in the command line it will not save what you write and just run what you are doing if you exit() out before saving what you have done. (not sure if it is possible to do that yet.)

#To create a file in the commmand line write **  python NameOfFile.py
